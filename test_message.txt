Hi :D

Thanks to be interested in this bot.

Now you are added as a tester to the bot, so you can use it now :D it'll not ignore you any more :P

Start first by setting your subscription preferences. By Default you are not subscribed to any notification messages.



You chose to be an Active tester, so what does it mean?

You may receive a message now and then, asking you to try a new feature. You may receive messages during testing. Some of those messages may have dummy content sometimes. I'll try my best to keep things stable as possible isA.

If you encounter any error, bug or so you'll be expected to report it on github.com/csed2018/messengerbot/issues (P.S it'll appear on your profile as a contribution :v) or directly to Hazem.

You have been subscribed to bot updates. You may become a regular user any time by unsubscribing form bot updates from the menu.



Finally, Any messages using this bot can be seen by the page admins (Hazem till now). So don't share any private data here.

Thanks and have fun.

You'll be kept out from any testing messages and other stuff as possible. However, things may get out of control as the bot is in its early stages. so be patient :D
